# Simple To-Do App

This is a minimal Flask web application that allows you to add and view tasks in a to-do list.

## How to run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `python app.py`
3. Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the to-do list.

Built by Edward Rogius as a demonstration project to practise Flask basics.
